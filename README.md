OLED Sleeper is a lightweight Windows tool to blackout or dim idle monitors, helping users prevent OLED burn-in and temporarily sleep secondary monitors for focus, gaming, or distraction-free work.

## The Problem

Many users have multi-monitor setups but want to turn off or dim secondary monitors temporarily without putting the entire computer to sleep. OLED and other displays can also suffer from burn-in or image retention if static images stay on screen too long. Windows’ built-in power settings are all-or-nothing — there’s no per-monitor control.

## The Solution

OLED Sleeper monitors each screen for activity. When a monitor is idle for a set time, it will either black it out or dim its brightness based on your preference.

## Features

* **Per-Monitor Idle Detection:** Choose which conditions keep each monitor active:
    * **Mouse:** Tracks cursor movement specifically on the target monitor.
    * **Focused Application:** Tracks activity within the active window currently displayed on that monitor.
    * **System-Wide Input:** Tracks overall keyboard and mouse input across the entire system (similar to standard Windows idle detection).
    * **Media Playback:** Uses Windows media sessions to detect playing/paused state, including muted video, with audio detection as a fallback for other applications. Playback follows visible application windows across monitors and continues after focus changes. When an application has multiple windows, the last focused window is used; Windows does not identify the exact video tab or window.
* **Per-Monitor Control:** Blackout or dim any monitor independently. Enable **Keep this monitor awake** and save to suspend automatic actions for that monitor.
* **Two Action Modes:** Full blackout or dimming (DDC/CI supported).
* **Instant Wake-Up:** Restore the monitor immediately when activity is detected.
* **Native WPF Application:** Uses Windows APIs for monitor and audio-session detection; no separate runtime tools are required.

## Requirements

* **Operating System:** Windows 10 version 1809 or newer, or Windows 11
* **DDC/CI Support (for Dimming Mode):** Dimming requires a monitor that supports DDC/CI brightness control via VCP codes. Most modern monitors support this, but it is not guaranteed on all displays.
